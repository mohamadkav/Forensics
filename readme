Here is Node Merge docï¼š

--------Here are some info about how to run the program--------

1. You need to download and install postgresql and postman first.

2. When you run this code, you must run read first, and input the file of data source in postman,
   the head is: localhost:8080/command/read, the body is: {"trace":"C:\\Data\\ta1-marple-e4-A.log"},
   You need to set the index of data file in class AvroReader, line 39,
   for example: if the data file is C:\\Data\\ta1-marple-e4-A.log, the index is ta1-marple-e4-a.index;

3. When you finish running "read", you can run "reduce", you also need to input the file of data source.
   the same to 1. the class is Reducer, the line is 86, the head is localhost:8080/command/reduce;

4. I set result text as "temp.txt" in class Reducer line 88, the result text stores all the events after reducing.
   For result text, we can get the size of this text to evaluate the result of system.
   The size of Marple-A is 60G before reduction, and Marple-B is 69G.
